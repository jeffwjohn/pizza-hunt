// create variable to hold db connection
let db;
// establish a connection to IndexedDB database called 'pizza_hunt' and set it to version 1
const request = indexedDB.open('pizza_hunt', 1);

// Here, we create a variable db that will store the connected database object when the connection is complete. After that, we create the request variable to act as an event listener for the database. That event listener is created when we open the connection to the database using the indexedDB.open() method.

// As part of the browser's window object, indexedDB is a global variable. Thus, we could say window.indexedDB, but there's no need to. The .open() method we use here takes the following two parameters:

// The name of the IndexedDB database you'd like to create (if it doesn't exist) or connect to (if it does exist). We'll use the name pizza_hunt.

// The version of the database. By default, we start it at 1. This parameter is used to determine whether the database's structure has changed between connections. Think of it as if you were changing the columns of a SQL database.

// this event will emit if the database version changes (nonexistant to version 1, v1 to v2, etc.)
request.onupgradeneeded = function(event) {
    // save a reference to the database 
    const db = event.target.result;
    // create an object store (table) called `new_pizza`, set it to have an auto incrementing primary key of sorts 
    db.createObjectStore('new_pizza', { autoIncrement: true });
  };
  // The listener we just added will handle the event of a change that needs to be made to the database's structure. IndexedDB infers that a change needs to be made when the database is first connected (which we're doing now) or if the version number changes.

// Thus, this onupgradeneeded event will emit the first time we run this code and create the new_pizza object store. The event won't run again unless we delete the database from the browser or we change the version number in the .open() method to a value of 2, indicating that our database needs an update.

// When this event executes, we store a locally scoped connection to the database and use the .createObjectStore() method to create the object store that will hold the pizza data. With IndexedDB, we have a veritable blank slateâ€”we'll have to establish all of the rules for working with the database.

// For that reason, when we create the new_pizza object store, we also instruct that store to have an auto incrementing index for each new set of data we insert. Otherwise we'd have a hard time retrieving data.

// upon a successful 
request.onsuccess = function(event) {
    // when db is successfully created with its object store (from onupgradeneeded event above) or simply established a connection, save reference to db in global variable
    db = event.target.result;
  
    // check if app is online, if yes run uploadPizza() function to send all local db data to api
    if (navigator.onLine) {
      // we haven't created this yet, but we will soon, so let's comment it out for now
      uploadPizza();
    }
  };
  
  request.onerror = function(event) {
    // log error here
    console.log(event.target.errorCode);
  };

  // This function will be executed if we attempt to submit a new pizza and there's no internet connection
function saveRecord(record) {
    // open a new transaction with the database with read and write permissions 
    const transaction = db.transaction(['new_pizza'], 'readwrite');
  
    // access the object store for `new_pizza`
    const pizzaObjectStore = transaction.objectStore('new_pizza');
  
    // add record to your store with add method
    pizzaObjectStore.add(record);
  }

  function uploadPizza() {
    // open a transaction on your db
    const transaction = db.transaction(['new_pizza'], 'readwrite');
  
    // access your object store
    const pizzaObjectStore = transaction.objectStore('new_pizza');
  
    // get all records from store and set to a variable
    const getAll = pizzaObjectStore.getAll();
    // Now, you may think that the getAll variable will automatically receive the data from the new_pizza object store, but unfortunately it does not. Because the object stores can be used for both small and large file storage, the .getAll() method is an asynchronous function that we have to attach an event handler to in order to retrieve the data. Let's add that next.

  // upon a successful .getAll() execution, run this function
getAll.onsuccess = function() {
    // if there was data in indexedDb's store, let's send it to the api server
    if (getAll.result.length > 0) {
      fetch('/api/pizzas', {

          'Content-Type': 'application/json'
          // Fortunately, the Mongoose .create() method we use to create a pizza can handle either single objects or an array of objects, so no need to create another route and controller method to handle this one event
        }

        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(serverResponse => {
